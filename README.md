Contact Tracing iOS App

Overview: Uses location tracking in the iPhone to easily keep track of other phones that come into a certain vicinity of the user. 

# Features
## Must have:

- Push notification tells user if they have come in contact with an infected individual and may need to quarantine. 

- Keep track of any quarantine duration

- Self report button => backend search other users in contact => notify them

- Every 5 min, the app logs the location of the phone, using gps coordinates.

- If a user reports themselves sick, the app will push notifications to all app users who have similar gps locations within a 100' radius cached in data, 

## Good to have:

- Vicinity map 

- Show the user locations they have been
